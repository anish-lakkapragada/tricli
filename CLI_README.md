# Tricli 

Tricli is a library that allows everybody to perform operations on my trie data structure. Note that the trie data structure is global and the same at any given moment for everyone. 

Tricli, given the last three letters of its name, is meant to be used inside of the
terminal as a command-line interface (CLI) and NOT inside of your code files. 

## How to install


## Operations tricli supports 

With tricli, you can add a word to trie, delete a word from the trie, clear (delete all words) the trie, have the trie displayed to you, and also get autocomplete suggestions for words in the trie for a given prefix. Let's look at these 
each more in detail.
