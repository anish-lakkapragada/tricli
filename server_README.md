# Server README

This is the readme containing the information about the server side to host and manage the trie data structure. 

## Overview

When the user wants to do an operation to the trie data structure, they simply use a command defined by the CLI. Then that command is processed and received to the trie data structure on the server side using a REST API. 

The way this works is that tricli sends a request with the given parameters on what operation the user wants to do and any other parameters (e.x. search value) in a JSON format. Through the REST API, the server processes it and sends back a response with any other information (e.g. was deleting successful.) Letâ€™s take a look at the tools I used to develop the REST API, client, and server.

## The Tools

To build the REST API, I used AWS API Gateway. When the command is processed by the CLI, the the client receives these parameters in JSON and sends this JSON data to the server using a GET method. I created an AWS Lambda function on the server-side to process this JSON data, and perform the desired operation on the trie data structure. 

The AWS Lambda Function is the `lambda_handler()` function in `lambda_function.py` and is called whenever a request is sent. Once the operation is performed, any information is sent back to the client using JSON data. The CLI then parses this information and notifies the user if necessary (e.g. key was found in trie.) 

I'll go over how the global state is managed next, talk about how to test the REST API with curl, and then go every operation and its involvement with the client and server. 

## Global State Management

A quick introduction on how I created the trie. The entire trie data structure is represented with a `Node` class I created (defined in `lambda_function.py`). The `Node` class stores for a given node stores its children nodes (thus only the root is requird to store the entire trie.)

Because the AWS Lambda function is not constantly running, the trie data structure is serialized into a (pickle) file. This file is stored in an AWS S3 Bucket. Every time the server is called, the pickle file in the S3 bucket is read to receive the root node and then the operation is performed on the root node (or it's children, or grandchildren, etc.). If the operation is changing the trie (i.e. ADD/DELETE), the pickle file in the S3 Bucket is rewritten with the new root node (that contains the changes). In order to perform S3 operations inside of AWS Lambda I had to learn to use `boto3`, AWS's Python SDK. I included the stack posts I used in lambda_function.py. 


## Testing

You can test the REST API using curl. All CAPITALIZED names in the url below are parameters, I will explain what they mean below. Make sure to enter all parameters or else you will incur an "Internal Server Error".

```curl
curl "https://a677fgt74e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/first/operations?action=ACTION&add_string=ADD_STRING&delete_string=DELETE_STRING&prefix_string=PREFIX_STRING&search_string=SEARCH_STRING"
```

Wait a few seconds, and you will get the JSON response (from the client) back in the terminal.

### Parameters : 

Note if you are doing a different action (say ADD) than the parameter (say DELETE_STRING) you can put something random for that parameter, because it will be ignored by the server. 

- ACTION : this can be "ADD" or "DELETE" or "CLEAR" or "AUTOCOMPLETE" or "SEARCH" or "DISPLAY". 

- ADD_STRING : this is the string you want to add into the trie. 

- DELETE_STRING : this is the string you want to delete from the trie. 

- PREFIX_STRING : prefix you want to receive autocomplete suggestions for. Look at the CLI_README.md for an example of using the autocomplete operation. 

- SEARCH_STRING : string you want to see if is in the trie (true/false)


### Examples!

First you may want to clear the trie completely. 

```curl
curl "https://a677fgt74e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/first/operations?action=CLEAR&add_string=nonsense&delete_string=nonsense&prefix_string=nonsense&search_string=nonsense"
```

If you want to add the string "string" you can do : 

```curl
curl "https://a677fgt74e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/first/operations?action=ADD&add_string=string&delete_string=nonsense&prefix_string=nonsense&search_string=nonsense"
```

Then you may want to search whether the string "string" exists : 

```curl
curl "https://a677fgt74e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/first/operations?action=SEARCH&add_string=nonsense&delete_string=nonsense&&prefix_string=nonsense&search_string=string"
```

and maybe display it (much prettier from the CLI, though). 

```curl
curl "https://a677fgt74e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/first/operations?action=DISPLAY&add_string=nonsense&delete_string=nonsense&&prefix_string=nonsense&search_string=nonsense"
```


## Each operation, in more detail 

### Add

The ADD operation is used for adding a string to the trie. Here in the client URL set action=ADD and add_string is the string you want to add to the trie. This data is sent to the lambda function, and returns back just {} (really nothing). 

### Clear

The CLEAR operation deletes all words from the trie. Here you just set action=CLEAR and all else can be meaningless. It returns back {} (nothing). 

### Delete

The DELETE operation deletes a word from the trie. Here you set action=DELETE and delete_string is the string you want to delete. This returns back {"works" : true} if it worked and None if it didn't. 

This information is needed because the CLI will take this information passed back to the client from the server and alert the 
user if the DELETE operation didn't work. The DELETE operation wouldn't work if the user
is trying to delete a string that isn't in the trie. 

### Display

The DISPLAY operation returns the list of words inside the trie to the client, and then the CLI processes this information and prints it out. The style of formatting can only be seen from the user's perspective, so check the CLI_README.md for that. Here set action=DISPLAY.

### Autocomplete

The AUTOCOMPLETE operation takes in a given prefix and returns what other words have that prefix and are in the trie. Make sure to set action=AUTOCOMPLETE and prefix_string = to whatever prefix you want suggestions for. 

### Search
 
The SEARCH operation takes in a given word and tells you (True/False) whether that word is in the trie. Set
action=SEARCH and search_string = to the string you want to search for. 

## Final Remark 
It is worth noting that none of these action=ACTION or the add_string, delete_string, prefix_string, and search_string parameters will ever be touched by the user. They are described here to make it easier for you test this REST API.
