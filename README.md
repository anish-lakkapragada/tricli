# trie challenge repo 

This repo contains all the work for my challenge. To read about the server-side of the challenge, the file server_README.md goes over it. The lambda_function.py is covered in that readme. To understand the CLI part of my project, go to the tricli (the name of my CLI) directory, which contains a file called CLI_README.md. This file goes over how to use the CLI and get it (available with pip). The tricli directory also has a tests folder containing all testing files. 

Thank you, and enjoy!
